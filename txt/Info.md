# Hello! This is where all the text files are stored.
## Wether its for random purpose, or for a random function, its here!
### Rocket has alot of commands for the *"Random"* module in python.
**So these will come in handy! They are all named what they include (of course) so it should be easier for you.**
> Rocket uses alot of important things from the random.choice module and has to use it due to the fact of not many other *"Reliable"* random modules.
Using random.choice(), the code will look like this if you want to include your *own* txt file for this.
```py
      n = open("txt/ip.txt", "r")
      ip = n.readlines()
      random.choice(ip)```
**You send the `random.choice(ip)` to the text channel.**
